This is a very simple Chrome extension to show the QR code for the URL of the current active tab.  You may then scan the QR code with your phone to share the link.

This extension is based on the [Getting Started](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) tutorial of Chrome Extension.  It makes use of the jQuery library, and the [QRCode for JavaScript library](http://www.d-project.com/) written by Kazuhiko Arase, and [a jQuery plugin](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/jquery-qrcode) written by Jerome Etienne.

A simple writeup for including QR code in a web page (more specifically, a ```jekyll``` page) can be found at [this link](http://fjdu.github.io/website/2015/09/05/qrcode.html).
